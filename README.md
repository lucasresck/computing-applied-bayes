# Computing for Applied Bayesian Modelling

Some notes and resources on computing techniques for Applied Bayesian Modelling.

**Motivation**

Bayesian modelling is now ubiquitous. And it's wonderful. It does, however, come with its own set of computational difficulties. In these notes we will try and collect tips and tricks for making fitting, diagnosing and using models under the Bayesian paradigm easier and more stable.

## General tricks

- Generating truncated random variables

## Numerical robustness

## Reparametrisation
